# Bangladesh Seasonal Dengue Analysis  

## Overview  

This project analyzes **seasonal dengue outbreak data** in the **Dhaka region of Bangladesh**, uncovering patterns in infection rates, demographics, and risk factors using **Excel for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization**.  

Dengue remains a critical public health issue, and this analysis aims to identify **high-risk populations, geographic hotspots, and key diagnostic markers** to support health interventions.

## Key Findings  

- **Total Tested**: 1,000  
- **Dengue Positive Cases**: 533 (**53.3% positivity rate**)  
- **Gender-wise Positivity**:  
  - **Male**: 476 tested, 252 positive (**52.9% positivity rate**)  
  - **Female**: 524 tested, 281 positive (**53.6% positivity rate**)  

### **Age Group & Infection Rates**  
- The **8-19 age group** has the highest infection rate, emphasizing the need for **targeted awareness campaigns**.  
- Significant infection rates are also observed in the **44-55 and 32-43 age groups**.  

### **Statistical Analysis on Diagnostic Markers**  
- **NS1 (0.97 correlation with Outcome)** is a **strong early-stage indicator** of dengue infections.  
- **IgG (1.0 correlation with Outcome)** suggests that **many infected individuals had prior dengue exposure**, possibly indicating a **new serotype outbreak**.  
- **IgM shows weak correlation**, meaning it is not a strong standalone indicator in this dataset.  

### **Geographic Hotspots**  
- **Top Acute Infected Areas**:  
  - **Jatrabari (29 cases)**  
  - **Demra (26 cases)**  
  - **Bangshal (24 cases)**  
  - **Tejgaon (24 cases)**  
  - **Mirpur (19 cases)**  
- **Areas with No Infection**:  
  - Sutrapur, Ramna, Keraniganj, Banasree, and New Market (19+ cases each).  

### **Housing & Infection Rates**  
- People living in **tinshed houses** show slightly higher infection rates than those in **buildings** and other housing types, indicating possible **environmental risk factors**.

## **Recommendations**  

Based on the data analysis, the following actions are recommended:  

1️⃣ **Targeted awareness campaigns** for **individuals with prior dengue exposure**, as they are at high risk, possibly due to a **new serotype**.  
2️⃣ **Medical and mosquito control interventions** should be focused on **acute dengue-infected areas (Jatrabari, Demra, etc.)** for outbreak control.  
3️⃣ **Special awareness campaigns for children & teenagers (Age 8-19)**, as they show the highest infection rates.
